## Why Daily Vocabulary Matters  

When learning German, consistency matters more than cramming.  
Studying ten words every day is more effective than 70 words once a week. Thatâ€™s because **spaced repetition** strengthens memory and helps you recall words faster in real-life conversations.

## How Falowen Supports Habit Building  

1. **Curated Word Lists**  
   Each day, Falowen introduces a small set of A1â€“B2 words tied to themes like *shopping, travel, or health*.  

2. **Examples, Not Just Lists**  
   Words are always shown in example sentences so you know how to use them naturally.  

3. **Smart Practice**  
   Falowen checks spelling, grammar, and pronunciation instantly â€” turning mistakes into learning moments.  

4. **Tracking Progress**  
   Daily streaks and score summaries motivate learners to keep showing up.

- Morning: Review yesterdayâ€™s words on your phone while commuting.  
- Afternoon: Do a 5-minute speaking practice with Falowen prompts.  
- Evening: Write 2 short sentences using todayâ€™s words.

## Final Thoughts  

Vocabulary is the foundation of fluency. With daily practice, youâ€™ll be ready not only for exams like **Goethe A1/A2**, but also for everyday conversations â€” whether itâ€™s ordering food, asking for directions, or making friends.
