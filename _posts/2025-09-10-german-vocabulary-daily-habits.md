## Why Daily Vocabulary Matters

When learning German, consistency matters more than cramming. Studying ten words every day is more effective than seventy words in one session. Spaced repetition strengthens memory and helps you recall words faster in real conversations.

<hr/>

## Minimum Daily Target

Falowen recommends a **minimum of seven words per day**. Seven is small enough to fit into a busy schedule and large enough to create steady progress. If you have extra time, you can explore more, but the trainer will still guide your pace so learning stays effective.

## How Falowen Builds Real Habits

Falowen turns short, focused sessions into steady progress.

<ul class="feature-list">
  <li><strong>Sentence Builder</strong>: assemble phrases and full sentences so new words move from memory into real use.</li>
  <li><strong>Vocab Trainer</strong>: more than ten thousand carefully selected words grouped by level and theme, with examples you can copy, edit, and speak aloud.</li>
  <li><strong>Dictionary with audio and downloads</strong>: hear standard pronunciation, slow it down for clarity, and download packs for practice when your connection is weak.</li>
  <li><strong>Open access</strong>: tutors do not assign word packs. Students have access to all words. The trainer uses smart pacing so you do not try to study everything at once or grind through items one after another without structure.</li>
  <li><strong>Save and sync</strong>: your progress, favorites, and personal word bank save automatically so you know what you have practiced and what is next.</li>
  <li><strong>Live stats and weekly overview</strong>: see correct and wrong answers, streaks, and mastery. Each week you get an overview of what you did with a clear choice to continue forward or start again for deeper mastery.</li>
</ul>

## A Sample Daily Routine

Morning: review yesterday’s seven words for five minutes on your phone.  
Afternoon: one speaking prompt that uses two or three of today’s words.  
Evening: write two short sentences and check feedback.

This simple loop keeps your brain in contact with German several times a day without overwhelm.

<hr/>

## Final Thoughts

Vocabulary is the foundation of fluency. With a daily target of seven words and smart pacing, you will be ready for exams such as Goethe A1 and A2, and for everyday moments like ordering food, asking for directions, or meeting new people.
