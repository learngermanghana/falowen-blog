## TL;DR
Connector Trainer is live for everyone in Falowen. It helps you link ideas with the right German connectors such as **und, aber, denn, weil, deshalb, obwohl, dass, wenn** using English explanations with German examples and instant tips. There is no scoring, only learning mode so you can focus on clarity and word order.

## Where to Find It
**Path:** Chat â†’ **Grammar** â†’ *Connector Trainer*  
Inside Grammar, look for the new Connector Trainer sub tab.

## Why This Matters
Good writing and speaking in German depends on clear links between ideas. Using connectors well
* boosts exam essays, especially the coherence score in Goethe tasks
* makes speaking smoother
* prevents classic word order slips after *weil* or *dass*, and the inversion that follows *deshalb*

## What You Get
* **Level aware suggestions:** Type your own connector, or let Falowen suggest connectors automatically based on your saved student level
* **English explanations and German examples:** Friendly, simple notes for quick understanding with examples you can reuse
* **Instant checks and tips:** The trainer checks your sentence and gives suggestions such as verb to the end after *weil* or *dass*, and inversion after *deshalb*
* **Ask follow ups:** Not sure why an answer is better? Ask a question right there and get a clear explanation
* **Learning mode without pressure:** No scores or timers, just focused practice until it clicks

## How a Round Works
1. Combine two ideas. We show them or you write them  
2. Choose a connector, or let AI suggest one for your level  
3. Type the full sentence  
4. Get instant feedback with a gentle fix and a short explanation  
5. Optional: ask a follow up to understand the rule deeply

## Quick Examples

**A2: Ursache â†’ Folge with *weil* or *deshalb***  
**Prompt:** *Ich bin krank. Ich bleibe zu Hause.*  
**Good answer with *weil*:** *Ich bleibe zu Hause, **weil** ich krank **bin**.*  
**Tip:** After *weil*, the verb goes to the end.

**A2 alternative with *deshalb*:**  
*Ich bin krank, **deshalb** bleibe ich zu Hause.*  
**Tip:** After *deshalb*, use inversion. That means adverb, then verb, then subject.

**B1: Gegensatz with *obwohl* and reported speech with *dass***  
**Prompt:** *Es regnet. Wir gehen spazieren.*  
**Good answer with *obwohl*:** *Wir gehen spazieren, **obwohl** es regnet.*  
**Tip:** After *obwohl*, keep Nebensatz order with the verb at the end.

**B1 reported speech:**  
**Prompt:** *Er sagt: â€žIch komme spÃ¤ter.â€œ*  
**Good answer:** *Er sagt, **dass** er spÃ¤ter **kommt**.*  
**Tip:** After *dass*, the conjugated verb goes to the end of the clause.

## Who It Is For
* Learners from A1 to B2 who want clean, correct linking  
* Students preparing for Goethe writing or speaking tasks  
* Anyone who prefers friendly English explanations with clear German examples
