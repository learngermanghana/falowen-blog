## Why motivation tools matter

Real progress comes from two things: **clear targets** and **tight feedback loops**.  
Falowen builds both into your daily workflow—without turning learning into a race.

---

## Your dashboard at a glance

On your **Dashboard** you’ll see:
- **Assignment Streak** — your consistency tracker.
- **Personal Leaderboard** — **your** total marks history (private to you).
- **Missed** — items you skipped.
- **Next Assignment Recommendation** — points you to the **one task you should do next**.  
  - If any assignment is **< 60%**, Next Assignment **locks onto it** until you clear it.

> Privacy-first: **we do not share** your leaderboard or progress with other students. Everyone only sees their own data.

---

## Pass & rewrite (fail forward by design)

The **pass mark is 60%**. Below 60%, a submission is labeled **Rewrite Required**.

What happens:
1. You get **specific feedback** (what to fix and why).
2. The task shows **Pending Rewrite** on your **Dashboard** and in your **Transcript**.
3. You **must resubmit** in **Course Book**. There’s **no time window** as long as your **contract is active**.  
   When a contract ends, unfinished rewrites require a **new contract** to continue.
4. On resubmission, the **new score overwrites the old one** (only the latest counts), and your transcript shows the improvement trail.

---

## Certificates of Completion (evidence you can show)

You receive a **Certificate of Completion** **only when**:
- **all required assignments are completed**, and
- **every assignment is ≥ 60%** (no pending rewrites).

Certificates list modules/units completed and can be downloaded or shared.

<div class="tip"><strong>Tip</strong> Certificates summarize; your <em>Transcript</em> tells the detailed story.</div>

---

## Transcripts (transparent progress, clear priorities)

Your **Transcript** captures:
- each submission with **score** and **Pass / Rewrite Required**,
- rubric highlights (e.g., Task completion, Grammar/Articles, Coherence, Pronunciation, Polite forms),
- tutor comments and timestamps,
- a visible **Pending Rewrite** flag for items below 60% until you pass.

Download it anytime or share with your tutor for targeted coaching.

## Attendance (consistency is a skill)

Falowen logs both **class attendance** (in-person or online) and **independent work**:
- Recorded Lecture replays, Grammar page reviews,
- Workbook submissions,
- Trainer checks (speaking/writing),
- streaks for **3-day** and **7-day** routines.

Attendance isn’t just a register—it feeds your **progress dashboard** and helps your tutor coach you better.

---

## Personal Leaderboard (private motivation, weekly rhythm)

Your **Personal Leaderboard** is **just for you**:
- Tracks **total marks** and improvements over time.
- **Weekly rhythm** helps you reset and focus.
- **Rewrites overwrite** the earlier score—your best, latest work stands.

Badges you might see:
<span class="badge">Streak Alive</span>
<span class="badge">Cleared All Rewrites</span>
<span class="badge">Speaking Focus</span>
<span class="badge">Writing Focus</span>

---

## Smart nudges (so you don’t miss a step)

You’ll get **automated notifications** when it matters:
- Email for feedback and important status changes,
- **Telegram** via **@falowenbot** for quick nudges (e.g., “Rewrite Required”, “Tutor commented”, “Next assignment ready”).

You decide how you want to interact; the system keeps you informed.
