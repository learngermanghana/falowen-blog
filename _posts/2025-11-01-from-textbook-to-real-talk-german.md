## The moment after “Wie geht’s?”
In early classes, students often begin confidently with *“Wie geht’s?”* — and then pause, smile, and stop.  
It’s not that they don’t want to talk; it’s that they’re suddenly unsure what comes next.

According to **Felix Asadu**, founder of Learn Language Education Academy and creator of Falowen,  
> “When students say *Wie geht’s?* they normally stop and smile, which implies they’re stuck. This happens mostly with early learners.”

That moment is the bridge between **memorized language** and **real conversation** — and Falowen was built to help students cross it.

## 1. Building confidence through structure
In A1, the focus is on **core grammar**: word order, verbs, and short exchanges.  
But from **A2 upward**, the structure changes — every student is expected to **speak individually for at least three minutes** per session.

Felix explains:
> “With A2 and B1, how the course is designed, each student is forced to speak with a minimum three-minute presentation time. That builds confidence naturally.”

This routine turns hesitant learners into expressive speakers who can hold full, meaningful interactions.

---

## 2. Preparation and self-practice
Students at Learn Language Education Academy don’t walk into class unprepared.  
They receive **materials ahead of time** to review vocabulary and grammar.  

> “We help by giving students material before class. Our A1 focuses on grammar, but A2, B1, and B2 are very interactive. Students use the Topic Coach and Ideas Generator for self-practice to analyze their mistakes before class.”

This self-guided routine ensures that when they speak in class, they already know the topic and can focus on expression, not translation.

---

## 3. Asking questions that make students think
The topic itself is never the problem — it’s how questions are framed.  
Teachers make sure that every prompt encourages reflection and opinion, not short answers.

> “Whatever the topic, we ask relevant questions that get them to think and talk.”

Instead of saying *“Describe your weekend,”* they might ask:
- *Was war das Beste an deinem Wochenende?*  
- *Mit wem hast du Zeit verbracht?*  
- *Was würdest du nächstes Mal anders machen?*

These small changes push learners toward **spontaneous, thoughtful conversation** — the essence of B1 fluency.

---

## 4. From silence to fluency in 30 weeks
The biggest transformation happens over time.  
Felix notes that complete beginners who join A1 with no prior German often start speaking and writing confidently within **30 weeks**.

> “We pick students with no knowledge, and from 30 weeks they speak so well and can write good standard German.”

That progress is driven by **daily engagement inside Falowen** — not just lessons.

---

## 5. Schreiben Trainer: turning speaking into writing
The learning loop continues beyond class.  
After practicing topics in Falowen’s **Topic Coach**, students move to the **Schreiben Trainer** to build writing accuracy.

> “The Schreiben Trainer boosts their confidence because they practice several letters by themselves, see mistakes ahead even before sending to their tutor.”

By combining both tools, students learn to **express**, **reflect**, and **refine** — a process that speeds up fluency.

## Practice this inside Falowen
Falowen’s **Topic Coach** helps learners move from short, memorized lines to real, responsive dialogue.  
The **Schreiben Trainer** converts those ideas into structured, written tasks with instant grammar feedback.

- Choose a topic in **Topic Coach** and chat in short exchanges.  
- Review your feedback and correct errors before class.  
- Open the **Schreiben Trainer** to write a short paragraph on the same topic.  
- Submit it for tutor review and keep track of progress on your dashboard.

This blend of speaking and writing builds confidence, fluency, and natural rhythm — exactly what learners need to move past *“Wie geht’s?”* and start real conversations.
