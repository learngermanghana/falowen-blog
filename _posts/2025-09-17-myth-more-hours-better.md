## The Myth  
*“The more hours you study, the faster you’ll get fluent.”*  

---

## The Truth  
Cramming for hours leads to fatigue and poor retention.  
Even **15–30 minutes a day** can build stronger habits and better memory.  

---

## The Falowen Solution  
Falowen is designed for **short, effective daily practice**.  
Whether you have 10 minutes or 30, you’ll make progress with consistent speaking and vocabulary tasks.
