## How Study Buddy generates suggestions
Study Buddy pulls in key study signals such as:

Using these, it can surface suggestions like:

- improve a weak area after a low score

So you always get *something useful*—even on days when you don’t know where to start.

## The AI behavior: quick, friendly, and level-matched
Study Buddy includes a **Quick Q&A box** for short questions.

When you type a question, Falowen sends it to the backend endpoint:

- `/chatbuddy/respond`

The AI is designed with a clear “Study Buddy persona”:

- friendly study partner tone
- matches your CEFR level
- **short answers (max 4 sentences)**
- clear English
- if correcting German: adds a short German example
- always ends with a follow-up question to keep you engaged

This keeps the experience fast and supportive—perfect for daily study momentum.
