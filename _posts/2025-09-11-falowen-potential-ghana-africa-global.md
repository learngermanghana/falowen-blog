## From Awoshie, Accra — to the World

Learn Language Education Academy started in **Awoshie, Accra (2023)**, growing from an online-only school into **in-person** learning as demand increased. In **2025**, we introduced **Falowen** to remove location barriers so students can practice and progress **from anywhere**—not only in a classroom.

Across our programs, we now celebrate **500+ student exam passes** (Goethe A1–A2 and beyond), built on a syllabus tested in real classes and refined by tutor feedback.

## Why Ghana Matters

Ghana is a hub of education and mobility in West Africa. Many learners aim to study, work, or reunite with family abroad—goals that require proven language skills. Falowen ties daily practice to real exam success and everyday communication.

## How Falowen Works Today

Falowen combines **technology + teaching** so learners get the best of both:

- **Hybrid access:** learn **in person**, **online**, or with **recorded lectures**  
- **Strict tutor standards:** tutors are **self-employed** and vetted for **consistency and quality**  
- **A tested course:** built by our school, improved with thousands of learner interactions  
- **Study assets:** recorded lectures, downloadable results/transcripts, and a **10,000+ vocabulary** bank with **Sentence Builder** and **Dictionary**

### Feature highlights
- **Exams Mode** — practice Goethe-style tasks in realistic scenarios  
- **Custom Chat** — topic-based conversations that feel natural and personal  
- **Schreiben Trainer** — structure, tone, and grammar feedback for writing  
- **Video of the Day** — quick listening + speaking prompts  
- **Attendance & Assignments** — class marking, assignment streak, leaderboard  
- **Smart nudges** — missed-assignment alerts, next-assignment recommendations  
- **Analytics** — average score and downloadable performance history  

<a class="btn" href="https://falowen.app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Try Falowen</a>

We have trained our **AI assistant** to accelerate feedback and practice quality. Our vision is that, in time, Falowen will let motivated learners progress even with minimal tutor contact—but today we pair AI with **human tutors** so students get reliable guidance and steady accountability.

## Expanding Across Africa

The challenges our Ghanaian learners faced are familiar across the continent: limited time, uneven access to partners, and inconsistent feedback. Falowen addresses these with structured tasks, instant corrections, and teacher oversight—so progress doesn’t depend on being in the same room or time zone. Our focus is **German** for now, pioneering **AI-integrated tutoring** in a space where this is still rare in Ghana, and we are growing across **West Africa** and beyond.

> “With only two German words before, I’ve expanded my vocabulary, learned to read and write, and can introduce myself and my family in German.” — **Patience A.** (shared with permission)
