## From Awoshie, Accra to the World

Learn Language Education Academy started in Awoshie, Accra in 2023, growing from an online only school into in person learning as demand increased. In 2025, we introduced Falowen to remove location barriers so students can practice and progress from anywhere, not only in a classroom.

Across our programs, we now celebrate more than five hundred student exam passes in Goethe A1 to A2 and beyond, built on a syllabus tested in real classes and refined by tutor feedback.

## Why Ghana Matters

Ghana is a hub of education and mobility in West Africa. Many learners aim to study, work, or reunite with family abroad, goals that require proven language skills. Falowen ties daily practice to real exam success and everyday communication.

We have trained our AI assistant to accelerate feedback and practice quality. Our vision is that, in time, Falowen will let motivated learners progress even with minimal tutor contact. Today we pair AI with human tutors so students get reliable guidance and steady accountability.

## Expanding Across Africa

The challenges our Ghanaian learners faced are familiar across the continent: limited time, uneven access to partners, and inconsistent feedback. Falowen addresses these with structured tasks, instant corrections, and teacher oversight so progress does not depend on being in the same room or time zone. Our focus is German for now, pioneering AI integrated tutoring in a space where this is still rare in Ghana, and we are growing across West Africa and beyond.
