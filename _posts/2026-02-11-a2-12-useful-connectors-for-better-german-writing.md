## 1) Speak in short sentences first
Start simple: subject + verb + object.

**Example:**
- Ich lerne Deutsch.
- Ich spreche jeden Tag.

## 2) Use a daily speaking routine (5 minutes)
Pick one topic and talk out loud.

## 3) Copy native sentence patterns
Write 5 model sentences and reuse them.

## 4) Record yourself
Listen for pronunciation and word order.

## 5) Get feedback
Use a teacher, a partner, or an AI speaking check.
