## Learning French A1 in Ghana and Africa is easier with a clear plan
If you’re trying to learn French in Ghana (or anywhere in Africa), you’ll notice something common:

There are many options, but many learners still feel stuck because they don’t have a routine.

Falowen’s French A1 course is built for beginners who want structure, consistency, and guided support.

---

## 1) What Falowen French A1 is (and who it’s for)
Falowen’s French program is designed as an optional A1 module with a weekly structure.

It focuses on:
- survival French for beginners
- short daily routines
- practical communication for everyday situations

It’s also designed to complement Falowen’s German program for learners who want to learn both.

---

## 2) The experience is shaped by daily practice and live classes
French A1 is built around two learning pillars:

### Daily practice
Learners follow daily activities that train core skills and keep progress steady.

### Live tutor-led sessions
Small-group live classes support the weekly plan and include tutor feedback.

Speaking and writing tasks are reviewed and discussed, so beginners don’t practice wrong patterns for too long.

---

## 3) Beginner onboarding (made for Ghana and Africa learners)
After signup, learners are guided with:
- start date and class schedule via email
- WhatsApp onboarding tips that support daily practice
- live sessions in small groups with tutor feedback

This format fits many learners across Ghana and Africa because it supports mobile-first learning and keeps communication simple.

---

## 4) The 28-day schedule design (French A1)
Falowen French A1 follows a 28-day plan. Each day includes:
- a topic
- a goal
- instructions
- grammar focus
- an assignment marker
- a reading and listening block (resources plus assignment marker)

This makes the course predictable and easy to follow for beginners.

---

## 5) What you learn across the month (simple overview)
The course is scaffolded from basics to real-life topics, then ends with review and integrated practice.

### Days 1 to 3: survival basics
