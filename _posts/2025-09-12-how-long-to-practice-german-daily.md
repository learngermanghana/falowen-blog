excerpt: "Falowen recommends one focused hour a day—or 1 hour for 3 days at A2+—with deep understanding of each task. Here’s how to make every minute count, even when you only have 15–30 minutes."

## The Daily Practice Question

“How much time should I spend on German each day?”  
The real key isn’t just the total time—it’s **consistency** and **how you use the time**.

## Falowen’s Recommendation: One Focused Hour

At Falowen, we recommend **1 focused hour** per day. The goal is not to rush, but to **understand each task deeply** within that hour.

A simple 60-minute structure:
- **15 min** — Vocabulary with examples (active recall, not passive reading)  
- **20 min** — Speaking drills (introductions, questions, polite requests)  
- **15 min** — Writing (2–3 short task responses)  
- **10 min** — Feedback review + corrections  

If you can’t do an hour every day, aim for **1 hour on 3 days** and keep **micro-practice** on the others (see plans below).

## A2+ Fast-Track: 1 Hour × 3 Days

From **A2 and upward**, our design helps learners **start speaking quickly** with just **one hour per day for three days**:
- **Day 1:** Exam-style speaking prompts + key vocab  
- **Day 2:** Short writing tasks + pronunciation focus  
- **Day 3:** Mixed simulation (speaking + writing) with targeted corrections

This concentrates effort while keeping it realistic for busy schedules.

## Prep-First Model (How Our Classes Work)

Falowen isn’t “just AI.” Students **prepare ahead** using in-app tools, then tutors **listen, coach, and refine**.  
This flips the classroom from passive to active:

**In the app before class**
- **Exams Mode:** Goethe-style tasks to rehearse realistic scenarios  
- **Custom Chat Mode:** Topic-based conversations that feel natural  
- **Instant feedback:** Corrections on grammar, structure, and pronunciation  
- **Submission tools:** Share responses for tutor review

**In class**
- Tutors focus on **what you bring**—clarifying, extending, and correcting—  
  instead of spending the whole hour explaining things you could have practiced in the app.

## If You Only Have 15–30 Minutes

**15-Minute Micro Plan**
- 5 min — Active vocab (say + type each item)  
- 7 min — One speaking prompt  
- 3 min — Review feedback/corrections

**30-Minute Balanced Plan**
- 10 min — Vocab with example sentences  
- 10 min — Speaking drill (record + review)  
- 10 min — Short writing task (4–6 sentences)

These short sessions compound fast when done **daily**.

---

## Why This Works

- **Focused practice > long, unfocused sessions**  
- **Instant feedback** accelerates learning  
- **Prep-first** ensures class time is personal, not generic

---

## Final Thoughts

Choose a plan you can **keep consistently**.  
- Best: **1 hour/day** with deep understanding  
- Busy weeks: **1 hour × 3 days** (A2+ sprint) + micro practice on off days  
- Minimum: **15 minutes daily** beats zero
