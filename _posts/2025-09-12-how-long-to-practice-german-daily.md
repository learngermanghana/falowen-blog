excerpt: "Falowen recommends one focused hour a day—or 1 hour for 3 days at A2+—with deep understanding of each task. Here’s how to make every minute count, even when you only have 15–30 minutes."

## The Daily Practice Question

“How much time should I spend on German each day?”  
The real key is not just the total time. It is consistency and how you use the time.

<hr/>

## Program Snapshot (Falowen Method)

<ul>
  <li><strong>Class duration</strong>: 1 hour to 1 hour 30 minutes, three days per week. We do not go beyond this.</li>
  <li><strong>Homework</strong>: 30 to 45 minutes after each class to lock in learning.</li>
  <li><strong>Daily minimum</strong>: complete one <strong>course-book assignment</strong> and a short <strong>grammar review</strong>. Vocabulary can be added, but it does not replace the core work.</li>
  <li><strong>Tools</strong>: Exams Mode, Custom Chat, <strong>Pronunciation Checker</strong>, and the <a href="/2025/09/14/schreiben-trainer-from-blank-page-to-confident-writing.html">Schreiben Trainer</a> for scoring and annotations.</li>
  <li><strong>Progress window</strong>: apply this rhythm for three months and students progress very well.</li>
</ul>

> Some newcomers worry the time is too small. That is a traditional mindset. With Falowen’s modern tools, the same ninety minutes achieve more because practice is structured and feedback is instant.

<hr/>

## A1: Practical vs. Lecture Time

At A1 we divide the work by skill so that class time matches how beginners learn best.

<ul>
  <li><strong>Schreiben and Sprechen</strong>: practice based. You speak and write in class with coaching.</li>
  <li><strong>Lesen and Hören</strong>: lecture based. Your tutor explains concepts so you understand what to look and listen for.</li>
</ul>

During Sprechen, use the <strong>Pronunciation Checker</strong> to compare your recording with model audio and correct sounds immediately.  
After class, homework reinforces what you learned: one course-book assignment plus a short grammar review.

<hr/>

## A2 to B2: Modern Class Flow

From A2 upward we keep the same total time but raise intensity with preparation inside the app.

<ul>
  <li><strong>Before class</strong>: open <em>Custom Chat</em> to prepare the Question of the Day and read one chapter ahead for speaking.</li>
  <li><strong>In class</strong>: each student gets at least three minutes of uninterrupted speaking, followed by targeted tutor questions. Use the <strong>Pronunciation Checker</strong> to tighten sounds and rhythm.</li>
  <li><strong>After class</strong>: a <em>Schreiben</em> task plus the remaining homework (thirty to forty-five minutes): course-book assignment and grammar review.</li>
</ul>

Because you arrive prepared, the hour is used for coaching, not for starting from zero.

<hr/>

## Falowen’s Recommendation: One Focused Hour

We recommend one focused hour on most days. The goal is not to rush. The goal is to understand each task deeply within that hour.

**A simple sixty-minute structure**
<ul>
  <li><strong>15 minutes</strong>: course-book assignment checkpoint and quick grammar review</li>
  <li><strong>20 minutes</strong>: speaking drills using the <strong>Pronunciation Checker</strong> (introductions, questions, polite requests)</li>
  <li><strong>15 minutes</strong>: writing practice in the <em>Schreiben Trainer</em> (two or three short task responses)</li>
  <li><strong>10 minutes</strong>: review feedback and apply corrections</li>
</ul>

If a full hour is not possible every day, do one hour on three days and keep micro practice on the others.

<hr/>

## If You Only Have 15 to 30 Minutes

**15-minute micro plan**
<ul>
  <li>6 minutes: course-book task checkpoint</li>
  <li>6 minutes: one speaking prompt with the <strong>Pronunciation Checker</strong></li>
  <li>3 minutes: quick corrections</li>
</ul>

**30-minute balanced plan**
<ul>
  <li>10 minutes: grammar review plus a short course-book exercise</li>
  <li>10 minutes: speaking drill with the <strong>Pronunciation Checker</strong> (record and review)</li>
  <li>10 minutes: short writing task in the <em>Schreiben Trainer</em></li>
</ul>

Small, daily sessions compound fast.

## Track Your Progress

Falowen shows live stats and a weekly overview. You see what you got right and wrong, your streaks, and your stars.  
For writing, the <a href="/2025/09/14/schreiben-trainer-from-blank-page-to-confident-writing.html">Schreiben Trainer</a> gives a rubric score and annotations. Each submission shows pass or not pass, with the current pass mark above 17. You can download a PDF of your work or share it to yourself on WhatsApp.

<hr/>

## Why This Works

<ul>
  <li>Course-book assignments and grammar review build a clear foundation</li>
  <li>Instant feedback and the <strong>Pronunciation Checker</strong> accelerate learning</li>
  <li>Prep first makes class time personal, not generic</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

## Final Thoughts

Choose a plan you can keep consistently.

<ul>
  <li><strong>Best</strong>: one focused hour per day</li>
  <li><strong>Busy weeks</strong>: one hour on three days plus micro practice</li>
  <li><strong>Core habit</strong>: complete one course-book assignment and a short grammar review each day</li>
</ul>
