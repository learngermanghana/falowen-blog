## The Daily Practice Dilemma  

Every learner asks the same question: *How much time should I spend practicing German each day?*  

The truth is â€” itâ€™s not about the **total time**, but about **consistency** and **quality of practice**.

## Why 15 Minutes Can Be Enough  

- **Focused sessions:** 15 minutes of speaking or vocabulary practice is better than an hour of distracted learning.  
- **Memory boost:** Daily repetition strengthens long-term recall.  
- **Fits into routines:** Even the busiest learners can commit to 15 minutes.  

With apps like **Falowen**, short, focused sessions are structured around exam-style tasks, making every minute count.

## When 30 Minutes Makes Sense  

- Preparing for exams like **Goethe A1â€“B2** within a short timeline  
- Practicing multiple skills in one sitting (speaking + writing + vocabulary)  
- Building fluency faster when you have the time to invest  

If you can dedicate 30 minutes daily, youâ€™ll see results faster â€” but it must still be **consistent**.  

---

## The Best Formula  

Think of practice in layers:  

- **15 minutes minimum** â†’ daily vocabulary or short speaking tasks  
- **30 minutes+** â†’ 3â€“4 times per week for deeper grammar, writing, and exam preparation  
- **Micro-practice** â†’ listen to a podcast, read a short article, or use German in everyday conversations  

This balance helps learners stay motivated without burning out.
