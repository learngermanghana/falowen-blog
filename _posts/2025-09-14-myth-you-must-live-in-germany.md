## The Myth  
*“You can only learn German if you live in Germany.”*  

Many learners think fluency is only possible with total immersion.  

---

## The Truth  
While immersion helps, it’s not the only way. You can recreate immersion from home:  
- Listening to German podcasts  
- Watching films and YouTube in German  
- Practicing daily conversations  

Consistency matters more than location.
