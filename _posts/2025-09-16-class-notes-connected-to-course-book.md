## The idea in one line

**My Course** keeps everything in one place for **all Falowen learners (A1–B2)**:

- **Classroom** → **Class Notes & Q&A** (group discussion only)  
- **Course Book** → **Recorded Lecture, Grammar, Workbook** (**source of truth**, where you submit)  
- **Learn Notes** → your personal notes and highlights

You can open *Class Notes* from **Classroom**, from a link inside the **Course Book** unit, or via **Quick Access** on the left side of the app.

## What lives where (clear roles)

**Course Book (content & submissions)**
- **Recorded Lecture** — watch/replay after class  
- **Grammar** — explanations for the unit  
- **Workbook** — assignments **to submit here**

**Class Notes (discussion only)**
- Lesson **title** + quick summary  
- **Badges/links** that point to the correct **Course Book** tab  
- A shared thread where students and tutors **discuss, pin fixes, and add examples**

<div class="badges">
  <div class="badge">Recorded Lecture → Course Book</div>
  <div class="badge">Grammar → Course Book</div>
  <div class="badge">Workbook → Course Book</div>
</div>

> Nothing is duplicated. **All materials are saved in Course Book.**  
> **Class Notes** keeps the *conversation* and the *pointers*.

## How to use it (simple flow)

1) **Open the unit in Course Book**  
   Watch the **Recorded Lecture**, read the **Grammar** page, and check the **Workbook** task.

2) **Discuss in Class Notes**  
   Go to **Classroom → Class Notes**, open the same lesson title, and:  
   - read pinned model lines and quick fixes,  
   - ask questions, add examples, or record a short pronunciation clip,  
   - see which **Course Book tab** each item links to.

3) **Submit in Course Book**  
   Complete the **Workbook** task and **submit inside Course Book** (not in the thread).

---

## Works for every level (A1–B2)

- **A1**: greetings (formal/informal), “Wie geht’s?” mini-dialogs  
- **A2**: polite requests, appointments, short emails  
- **B1**: descriptions, opinions with reasons, short reports  
- **B2**: arguments, summaries, formal letters

The **pattern stays the same**: content and submissions in **Course Book**; questions and class feel in **Class Notes**.

---

## Why this helps online and in-person learners

- **Feels like class** anywhere (online, in-person, or with recorded lectures)  
- **Everything is referenced**: lecture → grammar → workbook → discussion  
- **Nothing gets lost**: threads are saved, easy to review later  
- **Tutor in the loop**: teachers respond directly in the Class Notes thread

---

## Quick FAQ

**Where are the videos, grammar pages, and assignments saved?**  
In **Course Book**. That’s the source of truth.

**What is Class Notes for then?**  
**Group discussion and Q&A only**, with clear links back to the right **Course Book** tabs.

**Where do I submit my work?**  
Always **submit in Course Book** (Workbook tab for that unit).
