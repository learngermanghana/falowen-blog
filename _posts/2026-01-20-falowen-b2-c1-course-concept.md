## Why Falowen’s B2 and C1 feel different from “random practice”
Many learners reach B2 or C1 and feel stuck—not because they don’t study, but because they study without a system.

Falowen’s B2 and C1 courses are built around one clear idea:

> **A daily, structured routine that repeatedly trains exam-relevant skills until they feel automatic.**

Both levels follow the same flow (self-learning, no tutor), but the **expectations and Goethe formats** change from B2 to C1.

---

## The core concept shared by both B2 and C1
### 1) A daily routine built on the “core trio”
Every day starts with the same foundation:

- **Speaking recording** (topic response)
- **Writing practice** (Goethe-style task linked to the same topic)
- **Vocabulary skimming** (random, practical vocabulary in manageable chunks)

This loop keeps progress consistent: **Speak → Write → Build vocabulary**.

### 2) Authentic input: reading + listening tasks
After the core steps, learners work with curated:

- **Reading tasks** + comprehension prompts  
- **Listening tasks** + exam-relevant questions  

This builds real-world understanding and gives you language you can reuse in speaking and writing.

### 3) Mastery-first progress (score-gated)
Falowen encourages you to mark steps complete **only when your AI score reaches the set threshold**.

That means:
- less “finish fast”
- more real improvement
- clearer confidence going into exams

### 4) Writing that follows Goethe formats
Writing prompts are **exam-aligned** and tied to:
- the speaking topic
- the day’s language focus

So skills don’t sit in separate boxes—you train them together.

### 5) Vocabulary that stays fresh (randomized)
Vocabulary practice is **randomized** so learners keep meeting new words and useful expressions regularly.  
Chunks are kept manageable so learners can control the daily workload without feeling overwhelmed.

## What changes from B2 to C1 (same structure, higher expectations)
### B2 (advanced level target)
B2 is aligned with **Goethe-Zertifikat B2** expectations:
- clear structure and argumentation
- confident everyday + semi-formal language
- solid writing in B2-appropriate formats
- speaking that is organized and easy to follow

### C1 (proficient level target)
C1 is aligned with **Goethe-Zertifikat C1** expectations:
- more nuanced, precise vocabulary
- stronger cohesion and advanced connectors
- higher writing standards (tone, register, style)
- speaking that sounds flexible, natural, and well-reasoned

---

## A typical day in Falowen (B2 & C1)
1. Record your **speaking** response  
2. Write the **Goethe-style** task for the same topic  
3. Skim your **random vocabulary** chunk  
4. Do a **reading** task + questions  
5. Do a **listening** task + questions  
6. Improve until you hit the **score threshold**
