## Why sentence structure matters
German sentences follow a predictable rhythm: **the verb always comes second in main clauses.**  
Once you understand that pattern, you can build almost any sentence correctlyâ€”no matter how long it gets.

Below are five simple rules that explain this structure clearly.

---

## 1) The verb always takes the second position
This is the foundation of all German main clauses.  
Whatever comes firstâ€”subject, time, place, or objectâ€”the **finite verb** (the one that changes form) must stay in position two.

**Examples**
- *Ich lerne Deutsch.* â†’ Subject first, verb second.  
- *Heute lerne ich Deutsch.* â†’ Time first, verb still second.

**Common mistake:** putting two words before the verb.  
âœ— *Heute ich lerne Deutsch.*  
âœ“ *Heute lerne ich Deutsch.*

---

## 2) One element can come before the verb
The first position is flexible but can only hold **one element** (subject, object, or time phrase).  
Everything else follows after the verb in a logical order (often *timeâ€“mannerâ€“place*).

**Example**
- *Morgen fahre ich nach Berlin.* (Tomorrow Iâ€™m going to Berlin.)  
- *Nach Berlin fahre ich morgen.* (To Berlin Iâ€™m going tomorrow.)

Both are correctâ€”the meaning is the same, but emphasis changes.

---

## 3) The conjugated verb stays second, but other parts move
In tenses like *Perfekt* or with modal verbs, only the **conjugated** part counts for position two.  
Other verb parts go to the **end** of the clause.

**Examples**
- *Ich habe Deutsch gelernt.*  
- *Morgen habe ich Deutsch gelernt.*  
- *Ich mÃ¶chte in Deutschland arbeiten.*

**Key point:** *habe* and *mÃ¶chte* are second; *gelernt* and *arbeiten* move to the end.

---

## 4) In subordinate clauses, the verb goes to the end
If a sentence begins with *weil*, *dass*, *ob*, or *wenn*, the main rule changes: the **verb moves to the end** of that clause.

**Examples**
- *Ich bleibe zu Hause, weil ich krank **bin**.*  
- *Ich weiÃŸ, dass du Deutsch **lernst**.*

**Tip:** The main clause still keeps its verb second.  
*Weil ich krank bin, bleibe ich zu Hause.*

---

## 5) In questions and commands, the verb comes first
When asking yes/no questions or giving commands, the verb jumps to the first position.

**Examples**
- *Kommst du heute?*  
- *Hast du Zeit?*  
- *Lern Deutsch!*  
- *Sei ruhig!*

**Note:** For *W*-questions (*Was, Wo, Wie, Warum*), the *W*-word comes first and the verb immediately after.  
*Wo wohnst du?* / *Warum lernst du Deutsch?*

## Summary Table

| Sentence Type | Verb Position | Example |
|----------------|----------------|----------|
| Main clause | 2nd position | *Ich lerne Deutsch.* |
| Time/Place first | Verb still 2nd | *Heute lerne ich Deutsch.* |
| Subordinate clause | Verb at end | *â€¦, weil ich Deutsch lerne.* |
| Question (Yes/No) | Verb first | *Lernst du Deutsch?* |
| W-question | After W-word | *Warum lernst du Deutsch?* |
| Imperative (command) | Verb first | *Lern Deutsch!* |
