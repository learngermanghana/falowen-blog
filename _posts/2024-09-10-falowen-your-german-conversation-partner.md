## The Story Behind Falowen
Falowen started as a side project to keep classroom lessons alive after the bell rings. It grew into a friendly chat companion that keeps German fresh in your mind through casual conversation.

## What Makes Falowen Different?
- Available anytime you want to practice.
- Gives feedback in plain language, not grammar jargon.
- Remembers what you've learned and builds on it.
- Keeps sessions short so they fit easily into your day.

## Why Falowen Matters
Regular conversation turns vocabulary into something you can actually use. Falowen offers:
- A safe place to make mistakes.
- Gentle nudges to help you express yourself naturally.
- Encouragement that builds confidence with every chat.

## The Bigger Vision
Falowen is part of a wider mission to make language practice feel like a daily habit rather than homework. We see a future where learners connect through stories, culture, and curiosityâ€”not just quizzes.
