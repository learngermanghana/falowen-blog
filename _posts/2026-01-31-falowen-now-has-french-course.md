## Falowen just got bigger: French is now available 🇫🇷
Falowen started as a German learning app — and many learners have asked the same question:

**“Can you also add French?”**

Now the answer is **yes**.

We’ve added a **French course** to Falowen, so you can learn French with the same simple, structured learning experience inside the app.

---

## Why we added French
French is one of the most useful languages for:
- school and academic goals
- travel and communication
- work opportunities across Africa and beyond
- personal growth (and confidence!)

This update is for learners who want a clear path — not random lessons from different places.

---

## Who the French course is for
The French course is for:
- total beginners who want to start the right way
- learners who studied a bit before but want to build consistency
- anyone who wants a guided learning routine inside one app

---

## How to start
1. Open Falowen
2. Choose **French**
3. Start learning and stay consistent

👉 Start here: **falowen.app**

---

## What’s next
This is just the beginning. We’ll keep improving the French course based on learner feedback and usage inside the app.

If you try it, share what you want improved — and what you’d like to see added.

Thanks for learning with Falowen 💛
