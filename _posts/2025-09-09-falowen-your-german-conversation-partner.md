## The Story Behind Falowen

Falowen was born out of a real classroom need. At Learn Language Education Academy in Accra, Ghana, we saw students preparing for Goethe A1 and A2 who worked hard in class but lacked structured practice tools at home.

We asked a simple question: *What if students could practice speaking, writing, and vocabulary every day on their phone or laptop, and bring that work to class for coaching?*  
Falowen is the answer â€” a conversation-focused app that connects daily independent practice to teacher support.

## What Makes Falowen Different?

<ul class="feature-list">
  <li><strong>Real exam practice</strong>: rehearse introductions, questions, and polite requests in Goethe style tasks.</li>
  <li><strong>Vocabulary that sticks</strong>: daily sets with examples, not just word lists, so usage becomes natural.</li>
  <li><strong>Instant feedback</strong>: grammar, structure, and pronunciation checks so every minute counts.</li>
  <li><strong>Teacher integration</strong>: tutors review your submissions and coach what you have already built.</li>
</ul>

## How Falowen Works Day to Day

<ul class="feature-list">
  <li><strong>Exams Mode</strong>: practice realistic Goethe tasks to build confidence for the speaking, writing, and interaction parts.</li>
  <li><strong>Custom Chat</strong>: choose topics and tone for natural conversations that match real life.</li>
  <li><strong>Minimum daily target</strong>: seven new words per day to keep progress steady and achievable.</li>
  <li><strong>Sentence Builder</strong>: turn new words into phrases and full sentences so you can use them immediately.</li>
  <li><strong>Dictionary with audio and downloads</strong>: hear standard pronunciation and save packs for low-data practice.</li>
  <li><strong>Live stats and weekly overview</strong>: see correct and wrong answers, streaks, and a prompt to continue or restart for deeper mastery.</li>
</ul>

<div class="callout">
Falowen is not a replacement for teachers. It ensures you never stop practicing between classes, and it helps tutors focus class time on higher-value coaching.

## The Bigger Vision

Our mission is access, affordability, and effectiveness. Falowen helps learners in Ghana and across Africa practice from anywhere, then brings that work into class for feedback. Over time, we aim to let motivated learners progress even with minimal tutor contact, while keeping a clear path to human coaching when needed.
