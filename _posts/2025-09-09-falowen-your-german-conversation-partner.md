## The Story Behind Falowen  

Falowen was born out of a real classroom struggle. At Learn Language Education Academy in Accra, Ghana, we saw students preparing for their Goethe A1 and A2 exams. They worked hard, but often lacked practice tools outside the classroom.  

We asked ourselves, *What if students could practice their speaking, writing, and vocabulary daily, right from their phone or laptop?*  

The answer became **Falowen**, a conversation-focused German learning app that bridges classroom learning and independent practice.

## What Makes Falowen Different?

### 1. Real Exam Practice  
Falowen is built around Goethe exam structures. Students practice speaking parts (introductions, questions, polite requests) and get instant feedbackâ€”something most apps donâ€™t offer.

### 2. Vocabulary That Sticks  
Instead of plain word lists, we share daily vocabulary with contextual examples. Learning becomes a habit, not a chore.

### 3. Instant Feedback  
AI-powered corrections help students improve grammar, structure, and pronunciation immediatelyâ€”no waiting for a teacher.

### 4. Integration with Teachers  
Falowen isnâ€™t replacing teachersâ€”it empowers them. Tutors receive submissions, mark them, and send feedback directly. Itâ€™s a classroom and app ecosystem.
