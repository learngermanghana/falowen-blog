## Why the Schreiben Trainer matters

Many learners can speak a little yet freeze when the page is empty. The Schreiben Trainer guides you from idea to finished paragraph with structure, examples, and feedback you can act on immediately.

Falowen tunes tasks to your level automatically based on your contract, so the work you see fits where you are now.

## Your three tabs

### Practice Letters
Designed for exam style writing. You get pre filled questions that mirror common prompts, ideal for students who have finished class content and are preparing for the test. Write a draft, see corrections, improve the draft, and save your progress.

### Mark My Letter
Paste your draft to receive an immediate overview of your score with a clear pass or not pass signal. The current pass mark is above **17**. You also get a rubric with detailed feedback and annotations showing what was right and what needs work.

A second box opens for improvements. When you edit your letter there, the trainer shows a **delta view** that highlights changes between the original and improved versions. When you are satisfied, download a PDF or send the draft to yourself on WhatsApp. If you are practicing for class, you can share it with your tutor.

### Ideas Generator   (Letter Coach)
Paste the exam question or assignment instructions. Then work step by step with the Letter Coach to collect ideas, plan your structure, choose the right tone, and turn notes into a clean first draft. This is perfect for preparing a strong submission or warming up before you write inside Practice Letters.

## Scores, stars, and progress

Each submission shows whether it passes the mark and updates your **stars** as you keep writing. Live stats track correct and wrong answers across attempts, so you always know what to focus on next. You can keep going forward or restart a task for deeper mastery.

## How a session works

1. Choose your tab. For example, use the Ideas Generator to plan, then Practice Letters to write.  
2. Write a draft using model lines and structure prompts.  
3. Read the corrections and suggestions.  
4. Improve your draft.  
5. Paste the draft in Mark My Letter to see the rubric, annotations, and pass result.  
6. Download as PDF or share to yourself on WhatsApp. Submit to your tutor if you want human feedback.

<div class="tip">
<strong>Daily habit</strong> Aim for seven new words and use them inside a short written task. This turns vocabulary into real language.

## For Goethe exams

The Schreiben Trainer focuses on the content points, clarity, and polite forms that raters expect at A1, A2, and B1. Tasks feel familiar on test day because you have practiced the real patterns many times.

## Tutor support when you need it

Falowen keeps teachers in the loop. Students prepare first in the trainer, then tutors review and coach in class. Class time is used for higher value corrections and expansion, not for starting from zero.

---

## Try it

Open Falowen, go to **Schreiben Trainer**, and choose a prompt. Plan with the Ideas Generator, write in Practice Letters, then paste your draft into Mark My Letter to check the rubric and pass result.
