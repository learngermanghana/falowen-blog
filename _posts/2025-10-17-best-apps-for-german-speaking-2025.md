## Why this list
Speaking practice tools changed a lot this year. AI chats improved, exchange apps stayed strong, and live classes became more flexible. Below is a practical overview of what each option is best for, plus where Falowen fits for exam-style preparation.

---

## 1) AI chat and structured self-study
Babbel and Busuu now include conversation practice with voice or AI role-plays. They work well for short, guided dialogues that build day-to-day confidence and pronunciation.

**Good for:** short daily reps, confidence building, and flexible practice when you cannot book a live session.

---

## 2) Live classes and 1:1 tutors
Lingoda and Chatterbug offer scheduled small-group or private lessons. italki and Preply connect you directly to tutors for fully tailored sessions. These options provide the most real-time feedback and accountability.

**Good for:** rapid progress, accent feedback, and consistency through scheduled conversation.

---

## 3) Language exchange communities
Tandem and HelloTalk help you find native partners for text, audio, and calls. Exchange can feel authentic and social, but requires time-zone coordination and self-discipline.

**Good for:** cultural feel, spontaneous chats, and low-cost practice if you can manage the scheduling.

---

## 4) Official and free practice
The Goethe-Institut provides free online exercises and exam-style practice. These are reliable for topic coverage and task formats, especially at beginner and lower-intermediate levels.

**Good for:** trusted materials and exam-style topics.

---

## Where Falowen fits
Falowen is an all-in-one practice loop built for exam-led progress and daily accountability.

**Speaking and Conversation**
- **Topic Coach:** guided prompts by theme to move beyond small talk and mirror exam tasks.
- **Live student chat:** practice with classmates in structured rooms to simulate real conversations.

**Grammar and Sentence Control**
- **Grammar tab:** concise rules and examples aligned to CEFR.
- **Connectors Trainer:** drill *weil, deshalb, denn, obwohl, trotzdem* and apply them in context.
- **Sentence Trainer:** build longer, natural sentences from controlled inputs.

**Writing (Schreiben)**
- **Schreiben Trainer:** write from your own question, a pre-made template, or a task from your course book; submit for feedback and revision.

**Vocabulary and Reference**
- **Vocab tab with dictionary:** quick lookups plus daily word goals and quizzes.

**Courses and Content**
- **Full course book with recorded lectures** and a clear **syllabus** so self-study aligns with class work.

**Accountability and Motivation**
- **Dashboard:** leaderboard, assignment streaks, missed and recommended tasks.
- **Assignments:** weekly submissions with grammar-check before send.

**Scheduling and Cohort Awareness**
- **Calendar integration:** class dates and reminders inside the app.
- **Members and profile:** students update status and keep the cohort connected.

If your goal is steady A1 â†’ A2 â†’ B1 progression, Falowen replaces unstructured practice with a repeatable cycle: **topic â†’ chat â†’ grammar/connectors â†’ schreiben â†’ vocab review â†’ assignment submission**â€”all tracked in one place.

## Quick chooser: which path should you pick?

- **Daily, flexible speaking reps:** Start with AI conversations; layer in Falowen for exam-style tasks and submissions.  
- **Need live teacher time:** Book a class or tutor; use Falowen between lessons to stay consistent.  
- **Prefer chatting with natives:** Use exchange apps; keep Falowen for targeted exam prep and writing tasks.  
- **Want official formats:** Add Goethe practice sets; use Falowen to simulate the full flow from chat to submission.

## Final note
No single app does everything. The strongest setup in 2025 is one real-time option (class, tutor, or exchange) plus one focused practice loop (Falowen) that you can repeat daily without friction.
